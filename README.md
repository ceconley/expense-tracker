Future Iterations
In future iterations I will add functionality to allow users to track on an organization level.  Users will belong to organizations and organizations will have many users. 

Planning
I started my planning by drawing and ERD and wire frames.  Then I moved on to creating user stories.  After that I turned my user stories into psuedo code.  I found that in previous projects, when I was stuck on something, I would go and play with HTML or CSS.  This time I made sure that I saw issues to their end and stayed closer to my timeline and order of tasks.  This helped me stay on track.
